# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

The "Decimo a Calcetto" project aims to simplify the organization and management of amateur football matches by addressing one of the most common challenges: finding the last player to complete a team.

The primary objective is to create an innovative platform that streamlines the logistics of amateur football matches while fostering a sense of community. The system will help players connect with others for scheduled matches and it will even provide tools for organizers and referees to efficiently coordinate events.

To achieve this, "Decimo a Calcetto" will incorporate matchmaking algorithms, real-time notifications and geolocation-based search features. These components will enable players, organizers and referees to interact, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for all.


Target Users

The application is designed for three primary user groups:
1. players -- individuals seeking to create new games and/or join matches, even at the last minute.
2. team organizers -- individuals who need a platform to fill vacant spots in their teams or arrange matches with others.
3. amateur referees -- referees seeking nearby matches to arbitrate.

Key features

The system will support several use cases:
- players can search for and join available matches in the local area;
- team organizers can create matches, invite players and manage team composition;
- field managers can register sports fields, set availability of each field and accept bookings;
- referees can browse and select matches to officiate based on location, time and match type;
- notifications will keep users updated on match status, confirmations and cancellations.

The system will utilize distributed servers to provide availability, support for concurrent users, and real-time data synchronization.

Goals

The ultimate goal of the project is to deliver an intuitive and distributed platform that fosters community engagement and simplifies amateur football logistics.
By focusing on usability, reliability and several features,  the project amis to create a user-friendly experience for players, organizers and referees, allowing them to just enjoy the game.
